<!-- 
    Create a function that takes two arguments an array and a number. 
    The purpose of this function is to look through the array and find two numbers that when added together,
     their sum is equal to the number passed as argument. 
    It should return an array of those two numbers. 
    If it can't find any, it should return -1;
